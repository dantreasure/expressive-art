# silverpilen

Tanner is the *main* character and he is trying to separate from his other pair, dan
We are personifications of quarks
As he puts more energy in to trying to separate from me it finally reaches a point where in the void he inevitably creates another pair of us generate in its place.

-this comes from the inexplicable universe ep2

##Idea for transition
When the countdown reaches zero have the whole screen and everything fade to black then play a percussion ensemble,
cresciendoing in to the start of that video segment

###Episode 1
Tanner suddenly notices this figure dressed somewhat like him but not quite, very close to him but not doing anything and it totally freaks him out. He attempts to run away but is unable to separate himself. 

###Episode 2
Tanner learns to put more energy in to running away but somehow it always leads back to violently coming back in to contact with this other.

###Episode 3
Tanner puts so much energy in to separation that not only does the other find him again but there is no a perfect duplicate of him and the other making 4 total personas.

If there was a dead one of us on the side, they could be decay. 

###Times and Numbers

Silverpilen
"The train was used in the <b>1993</b> film Sökarna ("The Seekers") a film which took place in Stockholm. In the film, neo-Nazis supporters can be seen abusing immigrants on Silverpilen as it approaches Kungsträdgården metro station. <b>Two</b> people are later killed as they get pushed onto the track by the neo-Nazis and subsequently run over by the train, whose driver is powerless to stop in time."
